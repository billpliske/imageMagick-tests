<!-- SRCSET: Iâ€™m telling the browser that I have a series of images to choose from, depending on the need.The XXXw at the end of each line is the actual width of that image. -->

<!-- SIZES: I'm only declaring one percentage here, and that is any device that's a minimum of 0 pixels on up.  If I needed a device width to use a different percentage than 100vw ... I would have put a comma at the end of that first size line, and then on teh second line declare the media query, followed by something like 75vw and the closing quotes.  -->

<!-- src is the fallback for IE, and since we need to make sure the image will work on all devices, we go with the largest image. 

SIZES EXAMPLE (more than one)
